Care should be offered at no added cost for the patient, and treatment with relevant drugs should be available at reasonable cost for the individual patient. Currently, it is quite problematic that many female sex hormone preparations are not available at low cost in a number of countries. For example<span class="ins cts-1" data-cid="6" data-userid="11" data-username="Annapoorni Swamynathan" data-time="1574904879293" title="Inserted by Annapoorni Swamynathan - 11/28/2019 7:04am" contenteditable="true">,</span> transdermal drugs such as gels or patches are not available in all countries or are only available at high costs.

This sounds like an easy task. However, in relation to TS, as is the case in relation to many other rare and even common conditions as well, transition has proven to be troublesome, and several studies have documented that many patients ‘disappear’ in an apparent gap between <xref ref-type="scheme" language="UK" store="78" contenteditable="true">pediatric</xref> and adult care (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT00001 CIT00002 CIT00003" store="79" contenteditable="true">1, 2, 3</xref>).</pp1><pp1 store="80" contenteditable="true">It is also well<span class="del cts-1" data-cid="7" data-userid="11" data-username="Annapoorni Swamynathan" data-time="1574904928012" title="Deleted by Annapoorni Swamynathan - 11/28/2019 7:05am" contenteditable="false">-</span><span class="ins cts-1" data-cid="8" data-userid="11" data-username="Annapoorni Swamynathan" data-time="1574904928038" title="Inserted by Annapoorni Swamynathan - 11/28/2019 7:05am" contenteditable="true"> </span>documented that many patients will have undetected morbidity, which is only diagnosed once they are seen at a dedicated multidisciplinary clinic (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT00004 CIT00005 CIT00006" store="81" contenteditable="true">4, 5, 6</xref>). Although it may at first glimpse seem easy to care for females with TS – ‘would one not just have to substitute the missing female sex hormone?’ you might think. The reality is that many times it can be exceedingly difficult. This is because TS is a <i store="82" contenteditable="true">syndrome</i> – and as is the case with any other syndrome, lots of other conditions, diseases, socioeconomic circumstances, neurocognitive and <xref ref-type="scheme" language="US" store="83" contenteditable="true"><xref ref-type="scheme" language="UK" store="84" contenteditable="true">psychologic</xref></xref> challenges, issues with fertility, and the frequent need for ovarian donation, makes its necessary for the anchor person (being the pivotal physician) to be able to achieve a holistic picture of the condition. In other words, this anchor physician as the pivotal physician who coordinates care, most often an endocrinologist, needs to have a comprehensive understanding of the syndrome and should be willing to take on this obligation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT00007" store="85" contenteditable="true">7</xref>). This, in order to direct the patient to the services that can be needed in another medical specialties (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT00008" store="86" contenteditable="true">8</xref>).</pp1><pp1 store="87" contenteditable="true">Why is diagnosis of TS many times so tricky? Well, for one, most physicians still have the textbook image of a prototypical girl or woman with TS in the back of their mind and think that they can easily diagnose all females they encounter with possible TS. By now<span class="ins cts-1" data-cid="9" data-userid="11" data-username="Annapoorni Swamynathan" data-time="1574904992176" title="Inserted by Annapoorni Swamynathan - 11/28/2019 7:06am" contenteditable="true">,</span> however, numerous papers clearly show that this is not the case. In epidemiologic studies of TS the average age at diagnosis is around 15 years<span class="del cts-1" data-cid="10" data-userid="11" data-username="Annapoorni Swamynathan" data-time="1574905003018" title="Deleted by Annapoorni Swamynathan - 11/28/2019 7:06am" contenteditable="false"> of age</span> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT00009" store="88" contenteditable="true">9</xref>), and only rather few are picked up by prenatal screening programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT00010" store="89" contenteditable="true">10</xref>). In a large clinical study, the average age at diagnosis was not much lower, but was dependent on karyotype – 45,X females typically being diagnosed earlier (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT00011" store="90" contenteditable="true">11</xref>), while in another clinical study from Australia the median age at diagnosis was also 15 years (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT00012" store="91" contenteditable="true">12</xref>). This illustrates that diagnosis is much more difficult than many clinicians believe. Our current approach, which is dependent on presenting clinical features which in turn leads to referral to a <xref ref-type="scheme" language="UK" store="92" contenteditable="true">pediatrician</xref>, does not work, and many females with TS are only diagnosed during adult life. This leaves some adult TS on a diagnostic odyssey, especially those with an atypical phenotype, which is frequent among those only being diagnosed late, because adult caretakers are not that familiar with diagnosing TS. In fact, we think the only diagnostic avenue in the future will be to include TS, along with other sex chromosome abnormalities, in neonatal screening programs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT00013" store="93" contenteditable="true">13</xref>). This would allow complete diagnosis of TS without diagnostic delay.</pp1><pp1 store="94" contenteditable="true">In this edition of <i data-time="1574905058000" data-username="Annapoorni Swamynathan" contenteditable="true">Endocrine Connections</i>, a paper is published on the current state of affairs in Germany in relation to adult care of TS (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="CIT00014" store="95" contenteditable="true">14</xref>). This paper paints a rather gloomy and grim picture of current standards of care for adult women with TS. We think the authors should be commended for publishing their results and their analysis of why it is so in Germany.
